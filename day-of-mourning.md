Every year at the end of summer there will now be the Day of Mourning for Dead Reefs. The innaugural event will take place on Saturday the 2nd of April 2022 in King George Square Brisbane, Queensland and throughout the world. 

We will gather. We will remember. We will listen. We will reflect. We will mourn. 

Newly dead reefs will be added to a memorial list of reefs that have been irreversibly degraded, along with extinct species of sea life that depend on them. 

It will be a safe public space for processing difficult emotions. 

We will emerge empowered, resolute and unified. Secure in a community of love, care and justice. 

More details to be posted as the date approaches.
